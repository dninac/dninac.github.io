                        Nature has provided me with inspiration and a wealth of subject matter. This can
                        be found at every turn and in the most unexpected places. Faced with the many aspects
                        of experience, one is constantly confronted with a very challenging task of selection.

                    <p>
                        It is the seeing, the understanding and the response to this great wonder that is
                        transferred to the canvas or camera as the image. I prefer to maintain the spontaneity
                        of this phenomenon by not allowing the destruction of imagination by too much dissection
                        and analysis.</p>
